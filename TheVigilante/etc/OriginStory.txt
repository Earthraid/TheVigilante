 She sort of smiled for a moment, like she knew a secret she would never get the chance to repeat.  
 You had seen her just a few moments before, eating pizza a few tables over. 
 When the man came in with a gun, she never moved as he robbed the place. 
 He tripped as he ran out the door, the gun went off, she fell to the floor shot in the stomach. 
 The light faded from her young eyes over an eternity as you felt her heart slow to a stop.

 The sounds of chairs scraping against the tile floor as others fled brought you back to reality, where the would be robber had climbed to his feet and was headed for the door.
 In a moment of clarity and strength, you never could've believed yourself cappable of, you lay the girl down, grabbed the closest chair and threw it into the man's legs.
 He cried out as he fell and you were on him before he had even a chance to catch his fall.

 Now, as you scrub the the blood from your hands under the harsh light of this gas station bathroom, 
 you consider how the two mingle together. The blood of an angel and the blood of a demon. 
 The yin and the yang, the light and the dark.  
 They once maintained a balance, but now, the world has fallen into chaos.  
 No one you can trust or befriend. No one can feel safe. No one can walk the streets.  
 No one can stop this carnage.

 You scrub harder and harder as your adrenaline pumps in your ears. 
 You can still feel the air vibrate with the screams and the foot steps of those who ran away.
 The cowards. 
 You can taste the iron in the blood that crossed your face. 
 You can still feel the bones break under the weight of your hands as they crashed into his face. 
 "Justice." you whisper under your breath.
 But it sounds like an earthquake, a primal scream from inside your mind, a revelation. 
 
 You know what you need to do.
