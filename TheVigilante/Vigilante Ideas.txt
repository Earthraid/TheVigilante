Vigilante:

Need to write an origin story.  Just a random guy tired of bullshit to explain why your start rolls are so low.
Let character be named by player. string CharName = Console.Readline();

Uses Dictionary to hold crime levels as keys and assigns a value
to the key.

Criminals are on a list assigned with crimes commited.  If crime value is >
certain value player can decide to go capture.

Criminals assigned value of toughness, vigilante rolls against criminal.  If victory, gain 
level that changes value right of random number rolled for Vigilante.

Level up allows fighting tougher criminals.

List of firstName list of lastName to create new names.  Random grab of number of crimes based on difficulty.
Presents # of criminals to choose from.

If you lose to criminal, criminal is tougher next time.

Defeating opponents gives money that can buy armor(subtrahend enemy roll) or 
weapons(addends player roll).
{if (weapon){playerRoll + weaponVal}; if (armor){enemyRoll - armorVal};}

After a while you fight the Main criminal and move to a new city.
